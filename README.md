# labscript-qc
A collection of spooler code to make quantum circuits accessible for labscript.

We are proud to be currently sponsored by the *Unitary Fund*. It enables us to set up a good test environment and make it as straight-forward as possible to integrate cold atoms with circuits. This documentation will improve as the good goes beyond the initial piloting status.

More mature partner projects are:

- [qiskit-cold-atom](https://github.com/qiskit-community/qiskit-cold-atom) - qiskit connection to cold atoms
- [qlued](https://github.com/Alqor-UG/qlued) - User and circuit management for atom circuits
- [sqooler(https://github.com/Alqor-UG/sqooler) - The simulator equivalent of `labscript-qc`
